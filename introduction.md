# Introduction

> Arduino is common term for a software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures computer open-source hardware, open-source software, and microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)
>
> Arduino is an open-source project founded by Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis.
>
> Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer \(e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP\).

### Create

> We are finally ready to release create.arduino.cc, the Arduino platform that will provide the community with a more modern and flexible tool to write code, a more integrated way of accessing content and learning while doing.

* [Welcome Arduino Project Hub and Arduino IoT!](https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/04/03/welcome-arduino-project-hub-and-arduino-iot/)

### Project Hub

> Our tutorial platform powered by hackster.io

* [Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub)

### Internet of Things

> Connect your Arduino or Genuino Projects to the Internet and the World

* [Arduino Internet of Things Homne](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/)

### Arduino Cloud

> A simple tool to connect your Arduino boards to the internet and to each other. In order to use the tool you'll need to configure your environment.

## Comunity Support

### Processing

> Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

### Wiring

> Wiring is an open-source programming framework for microcontrollers.
>
> Wiring allows writing cross-platform software to control devices attached to a wide range of microcontroller boards to create all kinds of creative coding, interactive objects, spaces or physical experiences.
