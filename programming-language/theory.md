## Numeral Systems

### Decimal

> The decimal numeral system \(also called base 10 or occasionally denary\) has ten as its base. It is the numerical base most widely used by modern civilizations. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal)

### Binary

> In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 \(zero\) and 1 \(one\). The base-2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices. Each digit is referred to as a bit. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)

### Hexadecimal

> In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal \(also base 16, or hex\) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F \(or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f\) to represent values ten to fifteen. Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. Several different notations are used to represent hexadecimal constants in computing languages; the prefix "0x" is widespread due to its use in Unix and C \(and related operating systems and languages\). [Hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)

### Octal

> The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7. Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three \(starting from the right\). For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010. Two zeroes can be added at the left: \(00\)1 001 010, corresponding the octal digits 1 1 2, yielding the octal representation 112.

## Information Units

### Bit

> The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.\[1\] A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a 0 or 1. The term bit is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit shannon, named after Claude Shannon. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)
>
> The two values can also be interpreted as logical values \(true/false, yes/no\), algebraic signs \(+/−\), activation states \(on/off\), or any other two-valued attribute.

### Byte

> The byte \(/ˈbaɪt/\) is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer\[1\]\[2\] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)
